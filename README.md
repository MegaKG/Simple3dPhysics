# Simple3dPhysics
A Simple 3d Physics Engine for Charge, Rigid Bodies, Gravity and collisions

This is a work in progress.
Implemented So Far:
 - Output of Data to STDOUT
 - Collisions
 - Gravity Force
 - Charge Force
 - Lorentz Factor Calculation
 - Relativistic Kinetic Energy
 - Relativistic Mass
 - Variable time stepping


To Do:
 - Planar Bodies for gravity, charge and collision
 - Command line arguments
 - Reading Objects from File.
 - Rigid Body Physics
